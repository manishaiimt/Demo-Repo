# Description.

This is a Linear regression model that predicts the price of the house based on features/dimensions provided to it in the input data.
This model has been trained and tested on a similar dataset that has been commited to the main branch for any reference.

Following steps were executed in order to create/train the model.

1.Data Loading and Preprocessing: - Loaded the Housing dataset and then processed it to form a complete dataset by combining features and target values for price prediction.  

2.Data Splitting: - Split the dataset into training (80%) and testing (20%) to train and evaluate the model's performance.  

3.Model Implementation: - A Linear regression model was implemented from scratch(using python) and optimal parameters for the model were determined.

4.Model Training and Prediction: - Model was trained on the training dataset and then tested on the test dataset. 

5.Performance Evaluation: - Evaluated model's performance using the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) metric to evaluate accuracy. L1 and L2 regularization was used to reduce the mean absolute error.
